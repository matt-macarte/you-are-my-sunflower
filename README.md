# You are my Sunflower
**Still in early development!**
A simple web browser game about a sun and a sunflower


# Core Idea
Sunflowers are frequently associated with neurodivergent people; and that is what shaped the whole idea of the game.
Simple levels, but with slightly 'off' objectives.


# Core Mechanics
Given the core idea, all mechanics kept in mind a 'divergent' way of thinking, by not compromising to what's supposed to be the norm.


# Development

Still in development by 1 person (me, a cs sophomore, still learning webdev), so there's no release date.

## Version: 0.1.0 (alpha)
Coded all the basic stuff - and learned a lot about js.

## Next update
for version 0.2.0: Change core mechanics and visuals
Because I started this project for a uni assignment, I'll have to re-do the whole layout.
